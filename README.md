- **Discord Server:** Where the bot will be deployed.
- **Python 3.8+ Installed:** The bot is built using Python and requires version 3.8 or higher.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the bot's repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/discord-matchmaking-bot.git
cd discord-matchmaking-bot
```

*Replace `your_username` with your actual GitHub username.*

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure your `requirements.txt` contains:*

```plaintext
discord.py==2.3.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
Flask==2.3.2
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to securely store your Discord bot token:

```bash
touch .env
```

Open `.env` with your preferred text editor and add:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

*Replace `your_discord_bot_token_here` with your actual Discord bot token.*

**Important:** Ensure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.

### 5. Initialize Cache Files

Create empty JSON files for caching profiles and likes:

```bash
touch profile_cache.json
touch likes_cache.json
```

Initialize them with empty JSON objects:

```json
{}
```

*You can do this by opening each file in a text editor and adding `{}`.*

## Best Practices

To ensure the bot operates smoothly and securely within your Discord server, consider the following best practices:

### 1. **Secure Your Bot Token**

- **Never Share Your Token:** The `DISCORD_TOKEN` is sensitive and grants full control over your bot. Keep it confidential.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store tokens and other secrets in environment variables or secure storage solutions.
- **Regenerate If Compromised:** If you suspect your token has been exposed, regenerate it immediately from the Discord Developer Portal.

### 2. **Manage Permissions Wisely**

- **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant your bot only the permissions it absolutely needs to function.
- **Avoid Excessive Permissions:** Avoid granting administrative permissions unless necessary.

### 3. **Regularly Update Dependencies**

- **Stay Current:** Keep your Python packages updated to benefit from security patches and new features.
  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 4. **Monitor Bot Activity**

- **Check Logs:** Regularly review `bot.log` to monitor bot performance and identify issues.
- **Use Uptime Monitoring:** Ensure your bot remains online using services like UptimeRobot.

### 5. **Backup Data**

- **Cache Files:** Regularly back up `profile_cache.json` and `likes_cache.json` to prevent data loss.
- **Version Control:** Use Git to track changes and maintain history.

### 6. **Handle Errors Gracefully**

- **Implement Error Handling:** Ensure your bot can handle unexpected inputs or errors without crashing.
- **Provide User Feedback:** Inform users when commands fail or when errors occur.

---

## Troubleshooting

If your Discord bot is experiencing issues, refer to the following troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve common problems.

### 1. **Bot Goes Offline After Changing the Icon**

**Possible Causes:**
- **Code Errors:** Recent changes to the bot's code may contain syntax or runtime errors.
- **Deployment Issues:** Errors during deployment may prevent the bot from starting correctly.
- **Environment Variable Misconfiguration:** Incorrect or missing `DISCORD_TOKEN`.

**Solutions:**
- **Check Logs:** Review `bot.log` and deployment logs on your hosting platform for error messages.
- **Revert Recent Changes:** Undo recent code modifications to identify the culprit.
- **Verify Environment Variables:** Ensure `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correctly set in the `.env` file and on the hosting platform.

### 2. **Command Registration Error**

**Error Message:**
```
discord.ext.commands.errors.CommandRegistrationError: The command help is already an existing command or alias.
```

**Cause:**
- Attempting to create a custom `!help` command without disabling the default one provided by Discord.py.

**Solution:**
- **Disable Default Help Command:** Initialize the bot with `help_command=None`.
  
  ```python
  bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents, help_command=None)
  ```
  
- **Ensure Proper Order:** Define the custom `!help` command after disabling the default one.

### 3. **Bot Token Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Bot fails to connect.
- Authentication errors in logs.

**Solutions:**
- **Verify Token:** Ensure the token in `.env` matches the one in the Discord Developer Portal.
- **Regenerate Token:** If compromised or invalid, regenerate the token and update `.env`.
- **Restart Bot:** After updating the token, restart the bot to apply changes.

### 4. **Missing Dependencies**

**Symptoms:**
- Import errors in logs.
- Bot fails to start.

**Solutions:**
- **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- **Check Versions:** Verify that the installed package versions match those specified.

### 5. **Cache File Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Bot crashes when accessing cache files.
- Data not being stored or retrieved correctly.

**Solutions:**
- **Validate JSON:** Ensure `profile_cache.json` and `likes_cache.json` contain valid JSON (`{}` if empty).
- **Check File Permissions:** Ensure the bot has read/write permissions for these files.
- **Initialize If Missing:** If cache files are corrupted or missing, recreate them as empty JSON objects.

### 6. **Bot Sleeping/Inactivity**

**Cause:**
- Hosting platform marks the bot as inactive due to lack of activity.

**Solutions:**
- **Implement Web Server:** Use a simple Flask server within `bot.py` to respond to HTTP requests.
- **Set Up Uptime Monitoring:** Configure services like UptimeRobot to ping the bot's web server URL periodically.
